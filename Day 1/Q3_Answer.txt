Data types in JS:

JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
ex:
var length=12;//Number datatype
var name="Joe";//String datatype
var x= {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}; //objects

1)JavaScript Strings:

A string is a series of characters like "Letsupgrade".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
Example
var string1 = "Hello World";   // Using double quotes
var string2 = 'Javascript';   // Using single quotes

2)JavaScript Numbers:
The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

Example
var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals

3)JavaScript Booleans:
Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
This can be used to store yes/no values : true as yes and false as no.

Example
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(y == z)       // Returns false
Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

4)JavaScript Arrays:
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

Array items are separated by commas.

Example
var shape = ["Square", "Traingle", "Rectangle"];
Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

5)JavaScript Objects:
JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

Example
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Cena", age:50, eyeColor:"brown"};
The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor.

6)Date:
var date1 = new Date(0); // Thu Jan 01 1970 05:30:00 var date2 = new Date(1000); // Thu Jan 01 1970 05:30:01 var date3 = new Date(5000); // Thu Jan 01 1970 05:30:05
